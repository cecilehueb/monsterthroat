                The trolley totters dangerously and hits the sidewalk, but no one is concerned. Jumping
little packages, like toddlers on a break, fall back into their place. They are all the same, but
some of them are CAUTION FRAGILE, and others produce the sound of shattering glass. Yet
no one is concerned.

                The buildings look like churches. They are serious, and hollow too. Built from heavy stone and posted at prominent places: these buildings are on view. You stand in the middle of space and light, and you are feeling seen as well. Sunlight falls on your shoulders through the high, distant ceiling. Heavy swinging doors lead from the entrance to the main hall and lazily slam behind you. There are stained glass windows, displaying angelic figures, and stone carved statues, that refer to the five continents. Three counters are symmetrically placed in the space. Stamps, national, international and giro-affairs.

                The liberalization of the postal market at the end of 20th century drastically changed the architecture and labour of the postal services. The state-owned business became a commercial business, ready to compete. But don’t be nostalgic. To some extend the mail service has always been about efficiency. Postal codes were introduced in 1977 to simplify the sorting of mail: the organization thrives through a systematic classification of the places it conveys between, and no one wants their mail to be late. Managing time is inherently part of a system that functions so predictably in a city. But since it’s liberalization, the postal services’ strive for efficiency has taken a new level. It constantly cut costs at expense of its employees. Many jobs were lost and full time positions became part time. With the coming of flex-contracts job-security has deteriorated, while wages have been cut and work deskilled.

            <p>
                The post service disposed of its postoffices. It installed so-called ‘post agencies’ throughout the city. These service points are located inside shops. They combine their own business with the affairs of the postal service, further entangling postal services with commercial activities. Although the amount of mail sent between individuals has shrunk, the parcels market has grown over the last years. Post agencies mainly handle packages: these are purchases of online shops. Moving through the same commodity chain, e-commerce businesses and the postal services reach towards you from behind the same desk. Can the two businesses still be separated?

                Parcels addressed to, or transported via Amsterdam are sorted in a centre in Zuidoost and a crossdock nearby Sloterdijk. These are empty hallways from where parcels are transported to other depots. <span class="sub">We have left the centre.</span>We are now in: Halfweg, Almere, Westzaan, Sassenheim, Badhoevedorp, Zuidoost and Purmerend.

                This is an empty place. A large hallway. Tall walls. A floor so smooth that trolleys feel no resistance. jaa. It is a breath of empty air; a burp that goes inwards. It has doors on all sides, big ones and small ones. Things are stacked on top of each other. It is a bit like a church, but it is not built to be impressive. Its ceilings are attractive and so are its floors. You can’t wait to slide in it. You want to fill empty space with effective speed and roll out of the centre through one of its doors. You are yearning for it, in the most generic way, and with you are always many others.
