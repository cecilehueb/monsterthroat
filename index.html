                The trolley totters dangerously and hits the sidewalk, but no one is concerned. Jumping
little packages, like toddlers on a break, fall back into their place. They are all the same, but
some of them are CAUTION FRAGILE, and others produce the sound of shattering glass. Yet
no one is concerned.

                The buildings look like churches. They are serious, and hollow too. They are built from heavy
stone and posted at prominent places. They uncomprongmisingly take their space up in the
city. You are submerged in space and light. Some have heavy swinging doors that lead from
the entrance to the main hall, where sunlight falls through the windows in its heigh ceiling.
There are stained glass windows, displaying angelic figures, and stone carved statues, that
refer to the five continents. Three counters are symmetrically placed in the space. Stamps,
national, international and giro-affairs.

                The liberalization of the postal market at the end of 20th century has drastically changed
the architecture that houses postal services and the labour that performs it. The stateowned
business became a commercial business, ready to compete. But don’t be nostalgic,
the mail service has always been about efficiency. Postal codes were introduced in 1977 to
simplify the sorting of mail. The organization thrives through a systematic classification of
the spaces it conveys between, and no one wants their mail to be late. Managing time is
inherently part of a system that so predictably, precisely functions in a city. But since its
liberalization working conditions suffered. Many jobs were lost and full time positions have changed into part time jobs. Working under flex-contracts, job-security has deteriorated,
while wages were cut and the work got deskilled.

        <div class="scrollobject red" id="package">
            <p>
                The business disposed of its postoffices. Instead it installed so-called ‘post agencies’
throughout the city. These service points are located inside shops. They combine their own
business with the affairs of the postal service, further entangling postal services with
commercial activities. Meanwhile e-commerce businesses have grown. Although the amount
of mail sent between individuals has shrunk, the parcel market has grown over the last
years.4 Are E-commerce businesses and the postal service even separable? Both businesses
take part in the same commodity chain. Are they swallowed by the same thing? Where has
the church of our postal service gone?

                Now let me take you to another building.

                This is an empty place. A large hallway. Tall walls. A floor so smooth that it makes trolleys
bicker. They yearn for the hollow. It is a breath of empty air; a burb that goes inwards. It
has doors on all sides, big ones and small ones. Things here should be stacked on top of
each other. It is a bit like a church, but it is not build to be impressive. Its ceilings are
attractive, but so is its floor. You can’t wait to glide it. You want to fill empty space with
effective speed and roll out of the centre though one of its doors. You are yearning for it, in
the most generic way, and with you are always many others.
